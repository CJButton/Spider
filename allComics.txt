      synopsis: "A new vision based on Astro Boy - "The Greatest Robot On Earth" Pluto… Sahad… Goji… Abullah… Mysterious figures somehow involved with the serial murders of the great robots of the world. Europol's top robot detective Gesicht has been put on the case, and he's mere steps away from discovering the horrifying truth behind the killer and his motives… Little does he realize that he's also steps away from discovering a horrifying truth of his own… Masterfully crafted science fiction and suspense at its best! In an ideal world where man and robots coexist, someone or some has destroyed the powerful Swiss robot Mont Blanc. Elsewhere a key figure in a robot rights group is murdered. The two incidents appear to be unrelated...except for one very conspicuous clue - the bodies of both victims have been fashioned into some sort of bizarre collage complete with makeshift horns placed by the victims' heads. Interpol assigns robot detective Gesicht to this most strange and complex case - and he eventually discovers that he too, as one of the seven great robots of the world, is one of the targets.Contains Chapters 40 to 47.",

      synopsis: "In the 11th year of Meiji, on the day marked in the Western calendar as May 14th, time once again begins to flow. The shocking midday murder of Department of Internal Affairs Chief Ôûkubo a fait accompli, Kenshin leaves for Kyoto, scene of chaos and bloodshed--against the wishes of nearly everyone who knows him as the gentle 'rurouni.' Awaiting him there is Shishio Makoto, the hitokiri who replaced the cold-eyed assassin Himura Battôsai who forswore further killing and took up the reversed-blade sakabatô. But does Kenshin go to Kyoto for a duel...or for a death-match?!",

Bound by promises to both return Misao's 'Aoshi-sama' to her safely, and to face Shinomori himself in a climactic, decisive battle, the time is now to learn once and for all who has the will to live, who has the will to die...and who has the will to fight.",

In this new era of Meiji, it's getting harder and harder to tell the innocents from the outlaws.

Her task is to negotiate peace between kingdoms battling over the last of the world's precious natural resources.

Bridges are crumbling, rivers are washing past retaining walls, and everything in Edo is floating away, including our vengeful ronin, his foe, and his little boy. In an ironic show of samurai respect, little Cub Daigoro gets saved by the conniving Retsudo Yagyu. And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well -- but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length. This seems like it could be the deciding bout between the two, unless that nasty, Abeno Kaii gets in the way, and he seems to do that a lot lately.",
