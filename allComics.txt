      synopsis: "A new vision based on Astro Boy - "The Greatest Robot On Earth" Pluto… Sahad… Goji… Abullah… Mysterious figures somehow involved with the serial murders of the great robots of the world. Europol's top robot detective Gesicht has been put on the case, and he's mere steps away from discovering the horrifying truth behind the killer and his motives… Little does he realize that he's also steps away from discovering a horrifying truth of his own… Masterfully crafted science fiction and suspense at its best! In an ideal world where man and robots coexist, someone or some has destroyed the powerful Swiss robot Mont Blanc. Elsewhere a key figure in a robot rights group is murdered. The two incidents appear to be unrelated...except for one very conspicuous clue - the bodies of both victims have been fashioned into some sort of bizarre collage complete with makeshift horns placed by the victims' heads. Interpol assigns robot detective Gesicht to this most strange and complex case - and he eventually discovers that he too, as one of the seven great robots of the world, is one of the targets.Contains Chapters 40 to 47.",

      synopsis: "In the 11th year of Meiji, on the day marked in the Western calendar as May 14th, time once again begins to flow. The shocking midday murder of Department of Internal Affairs Chief Ôûkubo a fait accompli, Kenshin leaves for Kyoto, scene of chaos and bloodshed--against the wishes of nearly everyone who knows him as the gentle 'rurouni.' Awaiting him there is Shishio Makoto, the hitokiri who replaced the cold-eyed assassin Himura Battôsai who forswore further killing and took up the reversed-blade sakabatô. But does Kenshin go to Kyoto for a duel...or for a death-match?!",

      synopsis: "As the Juppongatana or 'Ten Swords' move to attack those at Aoi-Ya (Kaoru, Yahiko, Misao, and the rest of the Kyoto-based spy clan), Kenshin--accompanied by Sanosuke and Saitô--squares off against one of his most powerful opponents yet: Shinomori Aoshi, former Okashira or 'head' of the Oniwabanshû. Bound by promises to both return Misao's 'Aoshi-sama' to her safely, and to face Shinomori himself in a climactic, decisive battle, the time is now to learn once and for all who has the will to live, who has the will to die...and who has the will to fight.",

      synopsis: "To defeat an enemy in combat is one thing. To destroy an enemy's spirit by striking at what he holds dearest is another. Kenshin always felt that, so long as he wielded a sakabatô, those within his sight could be protected from harm, yet while he is incapacitated by the gargantuan Kujiranami of the 'Six Comrades,' Enishi seizes upon the opportunity to cripple Kenshin's resolve, and will to fight, for good. If Kaoru dies, will Kenshin's dream of a new Japan die with her?",

An eleventh-hour revelation suggests a possible weakness, but will the news come in time to help a critically wounded Kenshin, whose own strength is reaching its limit? In this new era of Meiji, it's getting harder and harder to tell the innocents from the outlaws. Perhaps, as Kenshin says, it should be for history to decide which side was right, and which side was wrong. The time for hitokiri such as Kenshin and Shishio has passed; let not the man decide the age...but the age, the man.",

How can he not be, when it was in Kyoto that, as the feared 'Hitokiri Battôsai,' he once made the streets flow red...? And yet, before he departs this place of so many memories, there are ghosts which must be put to rest. It's said that, when strong feelings are attached to a particular wound, so long as those feelings persist, the scar will remain. How did Kenshin get that cross-shaped scar on his face, and who was it that gave it to him?",
