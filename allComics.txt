      synopsis: "A new vision based on Astro Boy - "The Greatest Robot On Earth" Pluto… Sahad… Goji… Abullah… Mysterious figures somehow involved with the serial murders of the great robots of the world. Europol's top robot detective Gesicht has been put on the case, and he's mere steps away from discovering the horrifying truth behind the killer and his motives… Little does he realize that he's also steps away from discovering a horrifying truth of his own… Masterfully crafted science fiction and suspense at its best! In an ideal world where man and robots coexist, someone or some has destroyed the powerful Swiss robot Mont Blanc. Elsewhere a key figure in a robot rights group is murdered. The two incidents appear to be unrelated...except for one very conspicuous clue - the bodies of both victims have been fashioned into some sort of bizarre collage complete with makeshift horns placed by the victims' heads. Interpol assigns robot detective Gesicht to this most strange and complex case - and he eventually discovers that he too, as one of the seven great robots of the world, is one of the targets.Contains Chapters 40 to 47.",

      synopsis: "As the Juppongatana or 'Ten Swords' move to attack those at Aoi-Ya (Kaoru, Yahiko, Misao, and the rest of the Kyoto-based spy clan), Kenshin--accompanied by Sanosuke and Saitô--squares off against one of his most powerful opponents yet: Shinomori Aoshi, former Okashira or 'head' of the Oniwabanshû. Bound by promises to both return Misao's 'Aoshi-sama' to her safely, and to face Shinomori himself in a climactic, decisive battle, the time is now to learn once and for all who has the will to live, who has the will to die...and who has the will to fight.",

An eleventh-hour revelation suggests a possible weakness, but will the news come in time to help a critically wounded Kenshin, whose own strength is reaching its limit? In this new era of Meiji, it's getting harder and harder to tell the innocents from the outlaws. Perhaps, as Kenshin says, it should be for history to decide which side was right, and which side was wrong.

Strange human kingdoms survive at the edge of the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous fungal forest.

Her task is to negotiate peace between kingdoms battling over the last of the world's precious natural resources.

Bridges are crumbling, rivers are washing past retaining walls, and everything in Edo is floating away, including our vengeful ronin, his foe, and his little boy. In an ironic show of samurai respect, little Cub Daigoro gets saved by the conniving Retsudo Yagyu. And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well -- but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length. This seems like it could be the deciding bout between the two, unless that nasty, Abeno Kaii gets in the way, and he seems to do that a lot lately.",

      synopsis: "Battle Royale, a high-octane thriller about senseless youth violence in a dystopian world, it is one of Japan's best-selling - and most controversial - novels. As part of a ruthless program by the totalitarian government, ninth-grade students are taken to a small isolated island with a map, food, and various weapons. Forced to wear special collars that explode when they break a rule, they must fight each other for three days until only one 'winner' remains. The elimination contest becomes the ultimate in must-see reality television. A Japanese pulp classic available in English for the first time, Battle Royale is a potent allegory of what it means to be young and survive in today's dog-eat-dog world. The first novel by small-town journalist Koushun Takami, it went on to become an even more notorious film by 70-year-old director Kinji Fukusaku.",
